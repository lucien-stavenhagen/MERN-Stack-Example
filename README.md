# MERN-Stack-Example
NOTE: this branch adds authentication using JWT. The sensitive routes are protected in the Express back end and the React front end now has a login and new user components. Only one user at a time can be logged in and the JWT token returned by the backend is stored in localStorage.

Basic Posts app using the MERN stack, just to tutor myself in how to do it.

Basic fully CRUD enabled self-tutorial app using the MERN stack:
- MongoDB Atlas
- Mongoose ODM for MongoDB modeling
- Node.js JavaScript runtime
- Express web framework for Node.js
- React JS library for UI dev.

Other Node and React packages I've used to teach myself with this, my skills with them still pretty incomplete:
- nodemon 
- concurrently
- axios (alternative to Fetch API)
- react router (and DOM bindings)
- bootstrap 4 (not ReactStrap which would have been much better).

This does not have any state management at this time. It's not yet needed but Redux is probably what I'll use since I've learned at least the design pattern for Redux so far. But not yet how to wire it into React and intelligently design a complex state tree for a large app.
